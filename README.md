## IDEAS

* People can walk by and you can hit them
* There is a clock and you have to move enough boxes to enough places to keep your job
* We have one map and you move things from point A to point be on that map, but maybe we have multiple maps later on

## NOTES

* We'll have to use [MatterJS](https://phaser.io/examples/v3/category/physics/matterjs) to do our physics work
