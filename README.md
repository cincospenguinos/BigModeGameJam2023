# README

For Big Mode game jam in 2023.

## TODO

- [x] Get a guy on screen
- [x] Get the guy to move
- [x] Get guy to rotate
- [x] Get guy to move with respect to rotation
- [x] Get an input on screen with the guy
- [x] Get the inputs to work

### Nice to have

- [ ] Full screen button. Maybe in settings?
- [ ] Favicon?

## IDEAS

* People can walk by and you can hit them
* There is a clock and you have to move enough boxes to enough places to keep your job
* We have one map and you move things from point A to point be on that map, but maybe we have multiple maps later on

## NOTES

* I'm thinking we'll do the forklift game I've been spitballing for a while. It'll be fun, light-hearted, and silly, would push my skills, and would be doable in a little over two weeks
* We'll have to use [MatterJS](https://phaser.io/examples/v3/category/physics/matterjs) to do our physics work
